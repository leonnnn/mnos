Modules need to implement a defined API.  A module will be imported
using python’s import machinery.  The imported module needs to provide a
single method:

set_up(**kwargs):
    This method should return a module object that implements the rest of
    the API.  Typically, the set_up() method will call the constructor of a
    class which implements the module’s functionality.

The module object needs to implement the following methods:

module.install():
    This method should perform any action that needs to be done /once/ when
    the module is first installed (not at every system start).  Typically,
    this is the usual place to install necessary system packages.

module.run():
    This method should perform all actions that need to be done in order
    for the module to start providing its intended functionality.  For
    example, this will usually include generating config files from
    templates and calling init scripts to start a daemon.

module.teardown():
    This method will be called when the system is about to shut down and
    should perform any action that is required for a clean poweroff.
